My name is C͖͖̮̗̗͉̔̓ͧͨo͙͙̙̘̙ͤͫ͞c̨̨̣̮̝̈́̔ͯ̀͂o͙͙̙̘̙ͤͫ͞
And I am one of the survivors of Salomonis High massacre
Many of our classmate died that day
I do not want to recall what happened
but i think my information can help others
if you can read my message
that mean you have come back to the school
and that also mean you really need my help
as you may have read from the newspaper
even before the massacre
there were many death related events already
although the police say it is not related
and all of the death events were classified as accidents
but none of us believe it
there were just way too many deaths
no way all of those were accidents
those death events stopped after Carrie and P̤̤͖ͪ͑̕͜͜h̨͚͚͖ͯ̒̄͗͞ḛ̡̰̳͓̥ͬ͋ͪͧn̫̫̘̗͕̲̲̎ͥḛ̡̰̳͓̥ͬ͋ͪͧx͕͕͚͍̿̆͂͞ dead
after the massacre we did some investigation about this
and came up with a conclusion
no matter what please remember
let the dead return dead
