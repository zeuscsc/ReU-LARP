What is your goal?(500 words)
The most important goal I want to achieve in my life is to get married and be a happy family. Ever since I was a little girl I always tried to imagine my wedding and my perfect life after marriage. There is this part of me that can 't wait for me to be settled and have someone close to me that cares about me. But there is another part that has this fear of giving up my independence and not being truly loved.
There is a friend among us that used to be a girl and now boy, to be honest, I really don't like she come that close to my dear.  So I paid someone to give that bitch a lesson.
Nothing can stop me from achieving my goal.
I can imagine myself being very happy when I 'm married. I have never had a best friend that I could trust with everything, and to have a best friend living with me would give me comfort, security, and adventure.
Talking about my dream wedding, the bridal car will be a white Maserati because I want to arrive in style and it is one of the best Italian cars out there. The wedding ceremony will start at 5 pm because I do not want my guests to feel uncomfortable if it will be too hot. I will make sure they will not regret wearing their best cocktail dresses to me wedding because they will be comfortable. Since the wedding will be in a vineyard, only the best wines will be available for the guests to consume and it will be an open bar.
